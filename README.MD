Yusuf:

Added several new functionalities to the scraper.
These include the capability to pass in a list of types
which are used to scrape different parts of the page.
In the past we were reloading the page every time we wanted
to scrape a different piece of information from it and
this got to be very network intensive.

Other features added included:  
1. Getting the ratings of drugs  
2. Retrieving the dosage information  
3. Getting the pros of a drug  
4. Getting the cons of a drug
