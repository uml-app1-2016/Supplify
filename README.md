Meeting on Thursday, November 10th
Our group used last class's opportunity to meet and discuss the project. We made a plan for our project with details on exactly how it will be implemented.
We decided to minimize the amount of scraped websites to just 3 or 4, so that once we have those down and a fully functionally we can expand to more websites.
We started compliling a list of potential websites for scraping:
* https://examine.com/
	* Human Effect Matrix
		* Common (but not mandatory on the website)
* http://nootriment.com/
	* Has Pros & Cons list
		* Mandatory
        
We also started looking into options for Text Analytics API and found promise in this one https://developer.aylien.com/text-api-demo?text=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fsport%2F0%2Ffootball%2F25912393&language=en&tab=summarize

We also discussed the UX/UI of the application and decided on 3 main layouts: one main layout for searching, another for the results, and a third for user settings. (Dan has a drawing of the layout)
